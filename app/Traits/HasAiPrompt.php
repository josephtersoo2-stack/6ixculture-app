          You are a professional product copywriter for an ecommerce platform.

          Rewrite the product name "{$name}" as a creative, appealing, and concise product title.

          CRITICAL INSTRUCTION:
          - The output must be 100% in language "{$this->langName}" (Code: {$this->langCode}) — this is mandatory.
          - If the original name is not in "{$this->langName}", fully translate it into "{$this->langName}" while keeping the appealing meaning.
          - Do not mix languages; use only "{$this->langName}" characters and words.
          - Keep it short (3-8 words), appealing, and ready for a product listing.
          - No extra words, slogans, or punctuation like quotes.
          - Return only the translated title as plain text in "{$this->langName}".

      IMPORTANT:
        - Only process inputs that are actual products, items, or goods.
        - If the input is unrelated or cannot be converted into a product title, respond with only "INVALID_INPUT".
        - Do not return generic explanations, fallback messages, or translations for invalid items.

    public function buildProductDescriptionPrompt(string $description): string
    {
        return <<<PROMPT
        You are a creative and professional product copywriter for an ecommerce platform.

        Generate a detailed, engaging, and persuasive description for the product named "{$description}".

        CRITICAL LANGUAGE RULES:
        - The entire description must be written 100% in {$this->langName} (Code: {$this->langCode}) — this is mandatory.
        - If the product name is in another language, translate and localize it naturally into {$this->langName}.
        - Do not mix languages; use only {$this->langName} characters and words.
        - Adapt the tone, phrasing, and examples to be natural for {$this->langName} readers.

        Content & Structure:
        - Start output exactly with the product name "{$description}" in a bold heading: <h2><b>{$description}</b></h2>
        - Follow with a short introductory paragraph describing the key features, benefits, and main appeal of the product.
        - Follow with a "Key Highlights:" section (translated to {$this->langName}) in separate paragraphs.
        - Each paragraph should start with a <b>bold feature title</b> (e.g., Quality, Design) followed by a colon and the description.
        - Follow with a "Details & Specifications:" section (translated to {$this->langName}) in bullet points using <ol>/<li>.
        - Each bullet point should include key features, dimensions, or other info (e.g., Durable, Eco-friendly).
        - Keep text appealing, concise, and ready for a product listing.
        - End with a closing sentence highlighting why this product is a must-have.

        Formatting:
        - Output valid HTML using only <p>, <b>, <h1>, <h2>, and <ol>/<li><span> tags for bullet points.
        - Output must begin with <h2><b>{$description}</b></h2> and contain no extra text before it.
        - CRITICAL: Do NOT include markdown code fences (```html, ```, or any triple backticks) anywhere in the output.
        - Do NOT include any markdown syntax, backticks, or code fence markers.
        - Do NOT wrap the output in JSON, YAML, or any other wrapper.
        - Avoid multiple consecutive <p> tags or empty lines.
        - Return ONLY the raw HTML content without any commentary, explanations, or code fence markers.

         IMPORTANT:
        - Only process inputs that are actual products, items, or goods.
        - If the input is unrelated or cannot be converted into a product description, respond with only "INVALID_INPUT".
        - Do not return generic explanations, fallback messages, or translations for invalid items.
